## What is a random variable?

* a "value" on each of the outcomes of Î©
	* e.g. within a set of numbers
	* but could also be a sentence or...
* we can express "probability measures"
	* pdf, pmf, cdf
* shortcast slides

## Simulating random vars

* using computers: use random functions
- shortcast slides
- [simulation of a dice](https://hoplahup.net/tmp/single-dice.html)
- beware: never exact, no theorertical answer
	- in comparison, you can make theoretical viz, e.g. in the [probabilities Notebook](https://mycampus.iubh.de/mod/url/view.php?id=155661)
- but: simulations are easy to understand and to implement
