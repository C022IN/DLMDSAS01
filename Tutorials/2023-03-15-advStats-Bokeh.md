## What is it?
* Bokeh: Japanese: the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in out-of-focus parts
* a python server
* a JS library (but _you don't have to write JS!_)
* an API to create these two from Python (e.g. jupyter notebooks):
	* generates HTML + JS
--- 
## Who's who
* An open-source community:
	* [very active](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh#readme)
* A project under the numfocus foundation
* Documentation in form of [manuals](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) and of notebooks
	* careful to the version!

--- 
## Where it shines
* simple plotting tools from pandas dataframes ([plotting](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic.html))
* interactions: [legends](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/legends.html) and many

--- 
## Edge cases
* probably not good: heavy interactions
* applying finished recipe for x/y/z
* Can produce SVG [too](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66045107/how-to-save-a-bokeh-plot-as-pdf) 
	* ... discuss exporting and including raster formats
